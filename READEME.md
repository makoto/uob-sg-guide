# Assignment: Perceived liveability in Singapore

• Investigate liveability through observation
• Connect perception with spatial concepts (e.g. accessibility
• Reflect on spatial maps and analysis
• Translate experience into planning insight

## Key questions
• How do people experience liveability here?
• What spatial factors shape this experience?
• Insights to inform local planning and design practices?

## Requirements
• Define a clear spatial boundary for the study site from Master Plan
• Conduct on-site observations focusing on social intensity, accessibility, active mobility, microclimate, and public facilities
• Collect lightweight field data (e.g. notes, photographs, geotagged information)
• Supplement field observations with online and secondary data sources, such as maps, POIs, transport information, or environmental indicators
• Reflect critically on how subjective perceptions align with or diverge from objective spatial indicators
• The focus is on interpretation and critical reasoning, rather than exhaustive data collection

## Study areas
• Queenstown => This is what my group is focusing. Other area is covered by different group
• Bishan
• Outram
• Bukit Merah
• Newton

## Research framework
• Subjective information:
• Perceived liveability, i.e. how people feel liveable about this district?
• Objective factors (choose >=2 dimensions)
• Social intensity (e.g. POIs)
• Accessibility (e.g. street network, public transport network, green-blue network)
• Active mobility (e.g. walking, cycling)
• Microclimate (e.g. weather data)
• Public facilities (e.g. amenities, services)

## Deliverable

• A geospatial map to illustrate the distribution of perceived liveability and determined urban factors
• A report with an analysis (~1000 words)
